You've generated two JSON files containing the results of our analysis: augmented_original_data.json and consolidated_clusters.json. Here's a high-level description of what you'll find in each:

augmented_original_data.json:

This file contains the original project data, but it has been augmented with the results of our dimensionality reduction and clustering. Each object in this JSON array represents one of the original projects. In addition to the original fields like , tags,data_point_id, category_tags, title, subtitle, and description, you will also find:

umap_dim_1 and umap_dim_2: The 2D coordinates of the project in the UMAP-reduced space.
high_level_hierarchical_label: The cluster ID assigned to the project at the high level of hierarchical clustering.
medium_level_hierarchical_label: The cluster ID assigned to the project at the medium level of hierarchical clustering.
detailed_hierarchical_label: The cluster ID assigned to the project at the detailed level of hierarchical clustering.
consolidated_clusters.json:

This file provides a summary of the clusters identified at the three levels of hierarchical clustering. Each object in this JSON array represents a single cluster. It contains the following information for each cluster:

cluster_level: Indicates the level of the cluster ('High', 'Medium', or 'Detailed').
cluster_id: A unique identifier for the cluster (e.g., 'detailed_1', 'medium_5').
cluster_label: The original numerical label assigned to the cluster by the clustering algorithm within its level.
name: The AI-generated concise name for the cluster.
description: The AI-generated one-sentence summary describing the cluster's theme.
centroid: The 2D coordinates representing the approximate center of the cluster in the UMAP space.
members: A list of the indices (or IDs) of the original projects that belong to this cluster.
color: A hex code representing the color assigned to this cluster for visualization purposes.
