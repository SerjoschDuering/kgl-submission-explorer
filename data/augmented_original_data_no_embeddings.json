    "description":"The architectural design process is often hindered by a significant bottleneck: visualization. Translating 2D blueprints or basic 3D models into photorealistic renderings is a costly, time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge of complex software. This friction limits a designer's ability to rapidly iterate and communicate their vision effectively to clients.\n\nThe magic of our Nano Banana model lies in its two core, fine-tuned strengths: unwavering consistency and precise instruction following. It strictly adheres to the spatial constraints of the uploaded blueprint, which ensuring walls, windows, and doors are accurately placed. It also is great at applying the specified stylistic instructions from the text, such as 'brutalist concrete interior' or 'art deco lighting.' This fusion of capabilities transforms a days-long process into mere seconds, making photorealistic architectural visualization truly accessible and iterative.\n\nRyan Scovill.

    "description":"Our project, Tsuzuku Mirai, explores how AI can transform a single static image into a living, branching narrative. At its core, the system leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for two critical functions: first, to analyze the uploaded image in detail\u2014capturing its story context, visual style, and cinematic framing\u2014and second, to generate creative directions for possible futures. These directions are then passed to Nano Banana, which produces the corresponding future images.\n\nWhat makes this application unique is that it does not simply generate variations of what the user explicitly requests. Instead, the AI interprets the meaning and mood within the original image, and then proposes future scenarios that extend naturally from it. Each decision point presents two paths\u2014one realistic and one dramatic\u2014allowing users to actively shape the evolution of the story.\n\nThis combination of AI-driven interpretation and predictive storytelling creates an experience that goes beyond image generation: it turns user input into a living narrative canvas. By blending Gemini\u2019s analysis with Nano Banana\u2019s generative power, Tsuzuku Mirai demonstrates how AI can move from passive tool to active storytelling partner.",

    "subtitle":"Hallucinated maps to downplay the AI revolution, get your hallucinated maps here!",
    "description":"Hallucinated maps to downplay the AI revolution, get your hallucinated maps here!\n\nMy submission is a play on one of the popularly highlighted 'deficiencies' of vision language models. Often, maps generated with image models are unrealistic and prone to inaccuracies or hallucinations. Rather than that being annoying, however, I find that incredibly interesting, it's like a window to an alternative reality. For my hackathon project, I took the opportunity to explore AI Studio alongside Gemini Flash Pro 2.5. I wanted to see if it would be possible to easily use Google Maps as a reference point for generating fantasy maps. I used AI studio's image generator template, meaning I was working with typescript, a language I have little experience with. I have used the Google Maps API a little but the structure has changed a lot and there's some new functionality. Once I got the original idea working - turning a google maps image into a fantasy map, I experimented with adding a search functionality, as well as with a number of different prompts. Given how easy it was to work with Gemini and AI studio, I ended up creating different CSS templates for the different types of fantasy map. Prompts are hidden behind an icon to reduce the complexity of the user experience - I wanted to focus the user on choosing a location that was meaningful or well known to them, rather than constructing the perfect prompt.\nI think it worked out well - the places API is used to help users find a location, and then three different maps - an unlabelled street map, a labelled street map and a terrain map are passed to 'nano banana'. Another thing I could have tried is perhaps adding a temperature slider, using additional APIs (such as the pollen API for the mushroom kingdom or the complex Earth API) or allowing further balancing between different maps. However, I like this project as it's the first hackathon in a while where I haven't felt any pressure and stress. Google maps is a tool that I use every day, but I think its cool it itself started as a sort of side project. Anyway, hope you enjoy!\n\nalex casper.

    "description":"Nano Banana is the first model with strong enough spatial intelligence to reliably achieve this task. In fact, the stereogram pipeline itself could serve as a benchmark test of spatial reasoning for future vision models, since success depends on consistent subject rendering, accurate scale, and precise multi-view perspective.\n\nAt its core, the app relies on Gemini\u2019s sophisticated image-and-text understanding, executed through a two-step transformation pipeline. First, whether starting from a text prompt or an uploaded photo, Gemini regenerates the subject in a consistent isometric view against a clean background, demonstrating its ability to interpret and execute complex spatial instructions. Next, this image is reprocessed to generate a second view from a slightly shifted perspective, mimicking the parallax effect required for stereoscopic depth perception. The model\u2019s ability to maintain subject consistency while subtly altering the point of view is what makes the final 3D illusion possible.\n\nBecause this workflow is entirely model-driven, it can be easily adapted to VR headsets or AR goggles, where dynamically generated stereograms would enhance immersion and open new possibilities for interactive 3D media experiences. Nano Banana not only powers stereogram generation today but also establishes a pathway toward spatially intelligent applications of the future.",

    "description":"Shopping for clothes online or in-store often comes with uncertainty, Will this outfit suit me? How will it look when I wear it? These doubts lead to poor buying decisions, wasted time in trial rooms, and high return rates for e-commerce platforms.\n\nThis was the most challenging part to build. Most e-commerce apps allow users to share products with a single tap, so I leveraged that by integrating a share sheet in TryOn AI to capture incoming product links. The real challenge, however, was ensuring a seamless flow by automatically retrieving the product image. To solve this, I built a custom backend service that combines social Open Graph (OG) image extraction with a fallback mechanism, to ensure the correct product image is fetched and returned reliably for every shared link.\n\nMy goal is to make shopping smarter, personal, and more fun. TryOn AI reduces uncertainty, saves time, and helps users explore styles without hesitation. By combining Nano Banana with a seamless user experience, It is reimagination of how people interact with fashion.",

    "description":"Generate procedural isometric worlds using Gemini 2.5 with customizable themes, grid sizes, and terrain features.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d What It Does\nWorldForge transforms the tedious process of world-building into an instant, creative experience. Users simply select a grid size (8x8 to 64x64 tiles) and choose from six immersive themes (Fantasy, Medieval, Pirate, Steampunk, Modern, Apocalypse), and within seconds, Gemini 2.5 Flash generates a stunning, unique isometric world map complete with realistic terrain, strategic settlements, and thematic structures.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf The Problem I'm Solving\nTraditional world-building for games, tabletop RPGs, and creative projects takes hours or even days. Game developers spend countless hours on level design, D&D masters struggle to create engaging campaign worlds, and content creators need fresh, unique environments for their projects. Current tools are either too complex, too expensive, or produce generic, repetitive results.",

By uploading a familiar face\u2014such as a parent, teacher, or caregiver\u2014the system produces six core emotional expressions: happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, neutrality, and tiredness.\n\nThe project addresses a key challenge for autistic children, who often struggle with recognizing and interpreting emotions. Existing commercial cards rely on generic illustrations, which differ significantly from real human faces and limit learning transfer. Creating custom cards manually requires considerable time and resources for parents and teachers.\n\nConsistency: maintains the same facial identity across multiple emotions\nEdit: allows background, props, or text to be modified via natural language\nFusion: combines facial expressions with specific contexts (e.g., \u201chappy in the playground\u201d)",

Instead of just placing a product in a new background, it fundamentally reimagines the product itself within a new context, story, or form, while aiming to preserve its core shape and branding. The creative direction is specifically engineered to produce high-end, cinematic, and surreal visuals, similar to the style of a luxury fashion advertisement (like those from Jacquemus).\n\nIn essence, Product Transformer is a sophisticated yet user-friendly application that bridges the gap between a simple product photo and a full-fledged creative campaign concept, powered by advanced generative AI.",

    "title":"Interior AI Decorator",
    "subtitle":"Prototype",
    "description":"The Interior AI Decorator is a creative tool designed to take the guesswork out of home decorating. It allows you to use a photo of your own room as a digital canvas, making it easy to experiment with new furniture and decor before you commit to a purchase.\nHow It Works:\nUpload & Analyze: You start by uploading a picture of any room in your house. The application uses a powerful AI to instantly analyze the image and identify key objects like sofas, chairs, tables, and lamps. These detected items become interactive, highlighted with a subtle outline.\nGet Inspired: By clicking on any detected object, such as your current coffee table, the app presents you with visual ideas for replacements. In its current prototype stage, it shows a curated collection of inspirational images to spark your creativity.\nSwap & Visualize: The core feature is the \"magic swap.\" You can tell the AI which item you want to replace (e.g., \"the blue armchair\") and what you want to replace it with (e.g., \"a modern leather wingback chair\"). The AI then edits your original photo, seamlessly swapping the old item for the new one while maintaining the room's original lighting and perspective.\nThis process allows you to see exactly how a new piece of furniture would look in your space, transforming a typically difficult decision into a fun and interactive experience.\nProspects: Finding Real Products in Online Stores\nThe current \"Find Similar Items\" feature is a prototype that demonstrates the user experience with a fixed set of images. However, the ultimate vision for this application is to connect this visual discovery directly to real products available for purchase online. The potential here is enormous, effectively bridging the gap between inspiration and commerce.\nThe Path Forward:\nThe key to achieving this lies in leveraging AI-powered visual search. Instead of just identifying an object as a \"chair,\" the technology can analyze its specific visual characteristics\u2014its color, shape, style, and texture\u2014and then search the web for commercially available products that look just like it.\nHow It Would Work Technically:\nWhen a user clicks on an object in their photo, the app would:\nCrop the Object: Isolate the specific pixels of the selected item (e.g., the user's current sofa).\nSend to AI Search: Send this cropped image to an AI model equipped with a real-time web search tool (like the Google Search grounding in the Gemini API).\nPerform a Visual Query: The AI's prompt would be, \"Perform a visual search on Google Shopping for products that look like this image.\"\nReturn Real Results: The AI would then return a list of the top matching products, complete with their actual names, image URLs from the retailer, and direct links to the product page.\nChallenges and Opportunities:\nAccuracy is Key: The success of this feature depends entirely on the accuracy of the visual match. Finding a generic \"blue sofa\" is easy, but finding one that matches the specific style (e.g., Mid-Century Modern) and shade of the user's intended design is the real challenge. Continued advancements in AI are rapidly improving this.\nAPI Reliability: As we experienced during development, making complex AI requests that involve image analysis, web searches, and structured data formatting can sometimes fail. Building a robust system requires sophisticated error handling and prompt engineering to ensure the AI returns reliable data every time.\nA Seamless User Experience: The goal is to create a frictionless path from seeing an item in your room to finding a similar one to buy. This would transform the app from a simple editing tool into an invaluable assistant for interior design and shopping.\nIn conclusion, the prospect of integrating real-time product search is not a distant dream; the technology is already here. By refining the AI's instructions and building a resilient system, the Interior AI Decorator can evolve into a powerful platform that lets you redecorate your virtual space and then purchase the exact items you need to bring that vision to life.\nhttps:\/\/nano-banana-rdxo.vercel.app\/\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/insuperabilez\/nano-banana\n\nAleksandr Gaptrakhmanov.

    "description":"My web app directly provides an intuitive, no-code platform for on-the-fly image and sticker generation. Hope you find it helpful.\n\nCreating diverse, stylized visuals for any character is a major bottleneck for content creators, marketers, and developers, demanding significant time and artistic skill. My web app solves this by transforming the process into an intuitive, on-demand experience, built entirely upon the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Nano Banana within Google AI Studio.\nThe application's core is a powerful demonstration of Gemini 1.5 Pro's ability to perform complex, multi-conditioned image generation. It expertly synthesizes up to three distinct inputs: a Subject Photo for visual grounding, a Pose Reference for structural guidance, and an optional Style Choice for artistic transformation. This showcases Gemini's sophisticated multimodal reasoning, seamlessly merging a character's identity with a new pose and art style (e.g., \"LEGO\", \"Pixar Style\") in a single generative step.\nFurthermore, the \"Sticker Set\" mode highlights Gemini's capacity for efficient batch processing, generating up to 10 unique poses in a single run. Crucially, this entire application was prototyped using the \"Build with Gemini\" feature, proving how the model's advanced instruction-following can power a complex creative pipeline. My web app is a direct orchestration of Gemini's core strengths, making custom visual creation accessible to all.\n\nthisiskiet.

But creating these models remains painfully slow and expensive, requiring specialized software and actual 3D modeling skills. Most online sellers are stuck with flat photos while their customers squint and guess. We figured there had to be a better way.\n\nWhat it does:\nThis tool takes any product photo and turns it into an interactive 3D model that customers can actually rotate and inspect.\nThe process is straightforward: drag in a product image (or paste a URL if you're feeling fancy), and the system generates missing camera angles, then builds a complete 3D model. Users get a browser-based 3D viewer plus downloadable assets for their store. The whole thing takes about a minute, which beats the traditional approach of hiring a 3D artist or learning Blender.\n\n(And when I say \"how we built it,\" I'm giving myself too much credit, since Gemini 2.5 Pro (in the Google Studio App Builder) did all the heavy lifting.

    "description":"My project \"New Idea Please!\" is an experimental digital drawing canvas that helps artists break through creative blocks by blending their practice with Gemini AI image generation. When an artist isn\u2019t sure what to paint, they can summon wild, unexpected visual references generated by AI\u2014sparks that serve as inspiration rather than finished outputs.\n\nInstead of writing long, complex prompts, the canvas offers a dial-like interface: artists simply select an area of their drawing for the AI to riff on, and turn the dial to navigate through variations, as if steering around the latent space of imagination. This intuitive interaction feels more like exploring a sketchbook of possibilities than engineering prompts, keeping the focus on creative flow rather than technical details.\n\nUnder the hood, the system is powered by Gemini-2.5-flash-image, enabling fast, high-quality visual generations that stays consistent with the artist's style. The result is a tool that doesn\u2019t replace the artist, but instead acts as a playful collaborator\u2014offering unexpected imagery, textures, and moods that can be reinterpreted, remixed, and painted into original works.",

Our \"TerraForm 3D\" project leverages the advanced capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Flash Image features to overcome these hurdles.\nSpecifically, Gemini's rapid image analysis capabilities are central to efficiently interpreting raw topographical data, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and satellite imagery. This allows for quick extraction of elevation contours, land cover types, and hydrographic features, crucial for accurate 3D mesh generation. Furthermore, Flash Image assists in generating realistic or stylized textures and applying them dynamically to the 3D models, enhancing visual fidelity based on geographical context. The \"Flash\" aspect ensures near real-time processing, making the creation of detailed relief maps responsive and accessible, whether for scientific visualization, educational tools, or personalized topographical art. This intelligent data interpretation and visual synthesis are at the core of our application, providing a seamless transition from abstract data to tangible 3D landscapes.\nAttached Video Demo:\nAn engaging video demonstrating the TerraForm 3D project in action, showcasing the seamless generation of 3D relief maps from raw data and highlighting interactive elements.\nAttached Public Project Link:\nExplore our working product and interact with the AI-generated 3D relief maps firsthand.

    "description":"Comic Weaver is an interactive comic story maker where the user decides the genre and ending. I use nano-banana as a director and story-boarder. In a single multimodal call, it returns a clean 2\u00d73 comic page (no text) and strict JSON describing six panel visuals, short narratives, four mood\u2011biased choices, and any new NPCs. That directing pass sets the visual language\u2014character design, palette, lighting, and environment.\nNext, I ask nano\u2011banana to re\u2011create each panel as a standalone 4:3 image using the full page as a visual reference. Because nano\u2011banana accepts image inputs, I attach the storyboard page and optional character\/NPC portraits to preserve identity and continuity, and I pass per\u2011panel cinematography specs (shot, angle, lens, composition) from the JSON. When a mood vector reaches 1.0, I batch\u2011render the ending panels for cohesive closure.\nFor audio, I have Gemini draft a chapter ambience brief and per\u2011panel SFX\/stinger prompts; ElevenLabs renders background music or subtle ambience plus targeted SFX. Overall, the app leans on nano\u2011banana\u2019s image+text in one response, reference conditioning from images, and multi\u2011image outputs to turn one directing pass into a consistent, playable comic.\n\nAlimaa Ochkhuu.

The model is central because it acts as a sophisticated visual reasoning engine, not just a generator.\n\nAt its core, InkSynth\u2019s magic lies in the model's advanced multi-modal understanding. It simultaneously interprets a user's body photograph, one or more tattoo designs, and a complex text prompt filled with strict rules. This ability to synthesize instructions across different data types is what allows for photorealistic results. For the simulator, this means Gemini isn't just \"pasting\" a tattoo. It's performing a high-fidelity in-painting task, meticulously following textual commands to warp the design to the body's contours, mimic skin texture, and realistically adapt to the original photo's lighting and shadows.",

It combines natural language processing and image generation to turn written prompts into illustrated comic panels. The tool allows users to input dialogue, story ideas, or character descriptions, and then automatically produces visuals and layouts that resemble a comic format. Its goal is to make comic creation accessible to anyone, even without drawing skills, by leveraging AI to handle both storytelling and artwork.\n\ncatminton.

    "description":"Your Goto AI Tool for generating high quality visual experiences\/Storyboards from Music or Audio Stories\n\nSynesthesia AI is an innovative creative suite designed to materialize sound into sight, offering a novel medium for storytelling and expression. My application empowers users to translate the abstract world of audio into tangible, beautiful visual art through two powerful features. The Creator Studio acts as a digital canvas where users can generate a single masterpiece from music, voice recording, or text, and then iteratively refine it with powerful editing and image-remixing capabilities. The Visual Storyboard feature elevates this concept by automatically deconstructing a longer audio narrative into a sequence of key visual moments, generating a complete pictorial story accompanied by a written summary. Synesthesia AI serves as a powerful bridge between the auditory and visual worlds, allowing creators to truly see their sound.\n\nAt its core, Gemini 2.5 Flash acts as the application's analytical \"brain.\" Its powerful multimodal audio understanding is central to our features. It intelligently processes user-uploaded audio\u2014from instrumental music to spoken stories even on the spot voice recording \u2014to generate contextually rich and evocative image prompts. In the \"Visual Storyboard\" feature, it sequentially analyzes audio segments to build a narrative arc and synthesizes a final story summary, demonstrating its deep comprehension abilities.",

    "description":"An AI tool that lets users try on styles, redesign spaces, or edit their look\u2014and instantly connect those ideas with real products they can\n\nToday, people struggle to imagine how products will look on them or in their environment before making a purchase. Buying clothes online often leads to uncertainty about fit and style. Choosing furniture or d\u00e9cor is challenging without knowing how it will blend with a real space. Even makeup or design choices are difficult to visualize without trying them first. This gap between imagination and reality creates friction, hesitation, and high product return rates in e-commerce.\n\nVizCom bridges this gap. It is an AI-powered visualization tool that allows users to upload a photo of themselves or their surroundings and instantly see how products, styles, or designs would look in real life. Unlike simple editing tools, VizCom is directly connected with real products from commerce platforms. That means when a user tries on a shirt, places a sofa, or experiments with a lipstick shade, they aren\u2019t just seeing a mockup\u2014they can click through to the exact item and purchase it.",

First, there's the cognitive load of planning: using search to sift through endless food blogs, trying to find one recipe that meets your dietary needs and uses up ingredients before they spoil. Then, there's the friction of execution. Even after finding a recipe, you're left trying to interpret dense paragraphs of text\u2014constantly re-reading steps with messy hands and struggling to visualize what \"saut\u00e9 until translucent\" actually looks like. This entire process is riddled with guesswork, turning what should be a relaxing, therapeutic activity into a chore.\n\nMischef is an AI culinary co-pilot designed to eliminate that friction and bring the joy back to the kitchen. It starts with a simple photo of the ingredients you already have on hand. From there, Mischef handles all the heavy lifting: identifying what's usable, understanding your personal dietary preferences (like \"vegetarian\" or \"gluten-free\"), and generating three distinct, creative recipe suggestions in seconds. The result is a seamless journey from a chaotic fridge to a delicious, personalized meal, giving you back the mental space to simply enjoy the process of cooking.",

They get options to of what to do or they can type in anything and continue the quest. The image editing and interleaved text-image generation of the flash-2.5-image model are great. Image editing mode is great for transforming an uploaded photo into a custom character. I also use it for scene\/character consistency - for each scene I use the text generated by the model as a prompt with the character reference to generate the next scene. The model is great at following my prompt instruction for generating options even without Structured Outputs! Happy questing :)\n\nVivekHTrivedy.

    "description":"Google Hackathon Project Overview\nNerrame is a revolutionary AI-powered comic creation platform that serves as \"Canva for comics with a built-in Story Brain.\" The platform transforms comic creation from a complex artistic endeavor into an accessible creative experience for creators of all skill levels.\nAt its core, Nerrame features a comprehensive Story Bible system where users define their comic's world once\u2014characters, settings, tone, and art style\u2014then generate consistent comic pages while maintaining visual and narrative coherence. Users can create comics panel-by-panel with custom prompts or use one-click page generation that automatically creates all panels based on the script.\nThe platform includes robust community functionality with a public explore page, user profiles, and comprehensive sharing system. Comics can be toggled between private and public, with shareable links for external viewing. The integrated Character Library allows creators to build reusable character assets across projects.\nKey features include intelligent context-aware panel editing, transparent credit system (250 credits\/month for users), auto-save functionality, responsive design, and professional UI\/UX standards. The platform seamlessly blends creative freedom with AI assistance, making comic creation accessible while maintaining professional quality standards essential for winning the Nano Banana Hackathon.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image Features Usage\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation is the cornerstone of Nerrame Studio's creative engine, powering every visual element of the comic creation process.\nCore Implementation: The platform leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash's advanced image generation capabilities through a sophisticated context-aware system. Each panel generation request combines the user's Story Bible (characters, settings, art style) with specific panel prompts to ensure visual consistency across entire comic projects.\nIntelligent Context Integration: When users generate panels, the system automatically incorporates character descriptions, established art styles, and narrative context from previous panels. This creates seamless visual storytelling where characters maintain consistent appearances and the overall aesthetic remains cohesive throughout the comic.\n\nAdvanced Features Utilized\nDynamic scene composition for varying panel layouts\nCharacter consistency through detailed prompt engineering\nArt style preservation across multiple generations\nBackground generation with environmental context\nPanel-specific customization while maintaining story coherence\nCentral to Application: Gemini 2.5 Flash isn't just a feature\u2014it's the creative backbone. Without it, Nerrame couldn't deliver its core promise: transforming text-based stories into visually stunning comics. The AI's ability to understand context, maintain consistency, and generate high-quality imagery makes professional comic creation accessible to creators regardless of artistic skill level.",

    "description":"Google Hackathon Project Overview\nNerrame is a revolutionary AI-powered comic creation platform that serves as \"Canva for comics with a built-in Story Brain.\" The platform transforms comic creation from a complex artistic endeavor into an accessible creative experience for creators of all skill levels.\nAt its core, Nerrame features a comprehensive Story Bible system where users define their comic's world once\u2014characters, settings, tone, and art style\u2014then generate consistent comic pages while maintaining visual and narrative coherence. Users can create comics panel-by-panel with custom prompts or use one-click page generation that automatically creates all panels based on the script.\nThe platform includes robust community functionality with a public explore page, user profiles, and comprehensive sharing system. Comics can be toggled between private and public, with shareable links for external viewing. The integrated Character Library allows creators to build reusable character assets across projects.\nKey features include intelligent context-aware panel editing, transparent credit system (250 credits\/month for users), auto-save functionality, responsive design, and professional UI\/UX standards. The platform seamlessly blends creative freedom with AI assistance, making comic creation accessible while maintaining professional quality standards essential for winning the Nano Banana Hackathon.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image Features Usage\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation is the cornerstone of Nerrame Studio's creative engine, powering every visual element of the comic creation process.\nCore Implementation: The platform leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash's advanced image generation capabilities through a sophisticated context-aware system. Each panel generation request combines the user's Story Bible (characters, settings, art style) with specific panel prompts to ensure visual consistency across entire comic projects.\nIntelligent Context Integration: When users generate panels, the system automatically incorporates character descriptions, established art styles, and narrative context from previous panels. This creates seamless visual storytelling where characters maintain consistent appearances and the overall aesthetic remains cohesive throughout the comic.\n\nAdvanced Features Utilized\nDynamic scene composition for varying panel layouts\nCharacter consistency through detailed prompt engineering\nArt style preservation across multiple generations\nBackground generation with environmental context\nPanel-specific customization while maintaining story coherence\nCentral to Application: Gemini 2.5 Flash isn't just a feature\u2014it's the creative backbone. Without it, Nerrame couldn't deliver its core promise: transforming text-based stories into visually stunning comics. The AI's ability to understand context, maintain consistency, and generate high-quality imagery makes professional comic creation accessible to creators regardless of artistic skill level.",

    "description":"CODE PORTRAIT ARCADE is powered by the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, which serves as both the analytical and creative core of the application.\n\nOur system uses Gemini in two fundamental ways. First, for text-to-image \"Portrait Mode,\" Gemini analyzes a developer's GitHub profile to generate a detailed, context-aware prompt. Gemini extends its creative reasoning to enrich these prompts, adding symbolic objects for programming languages (like a coffee mug for Java) and distinct visual styles for different tech domains (e.g., cyberpunk for backend). This creates a symbolic portrait that visually represents the developer's unique coding identity.\n\nThe true innovation shines in our image-to-image \"Remix Mode.\" Here, we leverage Gemini's advanced multi-modal capabilities by providing it with two inputs: the user's GitHub profile picture and the AI-generated personality prompt. Gemini masterfully fuses these elements, enhancing the original photo with artistic stylizations that reflect the developer's coding archetype. This deep personalization, blending a real-world image with abstract professional traits, is a unique capability unlocked by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. It transforms a simple avatar into a meaningful \"Code Portrait,\" offering a cool and practical tool for the developer community.",

This creates theoretically infinite zoom depth, with Gemini generating progressively finer details at each level. The model maintains visual consistency across enhancements, ensuring smooth transitions between zoom levels.\nThe integration is optimized for performance through viewport-based processing (only the visible area is enhanced), intelligent caching to avoid redundant API calls, and request debouncing. This makes Gemini 2.5 Flash Image the core engine powering the application's unique infinite exploration capability.\n\nPamu_Wick.

First, its million-token long context window is central to our application, allowing the model to analyze an entire sequence of high-resolution construction photos at once to understand the overall pace and direction of a project. Second, its deep multimodal reasoning enables it to connect visual evidence (like scaffolding patterns) with its built-in knowledge of engineering processes to make logical inferences. Finally, its image generation capability allows it to translate this complex analysis into a single, photorealistic image of a predicted future state. These features together allow Foresight Engine to transform a series of static past images into a insightful glimpse of the future.\n\nThis project is a submission for the Kaggle Nano-Banana Hackathon.

This is a fun and unusual take a new prompt modality which is a \"loop\" allowing you to replay a prompt repeatedly on successive prompt outputs.\nHow to Use Looper?\nUpload an image or enter a prompt then set the number of \"loops\" you want to make on that prompt and any input assets. Then it will sit and iterate on your prompt! It's a fun little tool to see what Nano Banana and these multimodal enabled LLMs can do.\nWhy Prompt Looping?\nThis is a somewhat esoteric project in that its not likely to be a commercial success but it does explore a \"loop\" prompt modality. The limits of modern multimodal AI models can be seen easily, for example by asking Nano Banana to complete a visual series using DrawGPT Looper. This started as an exercise in exploring generational drift & AI entropy and ended being a fun little exercise around a new way to think about prompting.\nTry It Out!\nLink: https:\/\/drawgpt.ai\/looper\/\nYouTube Video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R2yxejJeNEg\n\nYou can use this to loop prompts to create a series of images, small animation, and more.\n\nKickiniteasy.

Staging means adding furniture, artwork etc. to make the house look more appealing to the buyers. It also helps potential buyers get an idea of the space and how it can be used.\n\nThey then get the house photographed for the listing. At this point, if the house is not staged, the photographs in the real estate listing are usualy bare rooms and potential buyers or tenants may not be able to visualize the space well. Or if the house is staged, the seller needs to pay for the staging service and they also have limited creative inputs and don't know what the end product will look like.\n\nThis project aims to solve this problem by using AI to stage the house and generate photographs.",

    "description":"Character Consistency enables the same child character to appear identically across the scenes - a breakthrough that wasn't achievable with previous image AI. Parents upload one photo, and our system generates their child as an illustrated protagonist that remains visually consistent throughout the adventure.\n\nCombined with Gemini's world knowledge, StoryMagic generates age-appropriate, educational narratives that adapt to each scene. The integration with ElevenLabs' advanced continuity features creates seamless narration across the entire story - we leverage their continuity related parameters to maintain consistent voice characteristics, pacing, and emotional tone as the story progresses from page to page. This means the narrator doesn't sound disjointed between scenes; instead, each page flows naturally into the next with preserved intonation patterns and speaking style, creating a truly immersive multi-sensory storytelling experience.\n\nThis dual consistency - visual through Gemini and auditory through ElevenLabs - solves a real problem: parents struggle to find truly personalized books featuring their children, and existing solutions can't maintain character consistency across multiple illustrations or provide smooth, connected narration throughout an entire story.",

    "description":"\"Generating novel images through multi-source input fusion and combinatorial synthesis.\"\n\nNano Banana Hackathon Submission\nProject Chimera: Powered by Gemini Integration\nAt the heart of Project Chimera lies the powerful multimodal engine of the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. The core of our application is its ability to perform sophisticated image editing and synthesis by combining complex user inputs: a main image, multiple reference images, and a dynamically generated, highly detailed text prompt.\nThe key Gemini feature we leverage is its advanced multimodal understanding. This enables users to seamlessly fuse concepts, styles, and elements from various sources. For example, a user can provide an image of a character, an image of a futuristic armor set, and an image of a specific art style, and then direct the process with a detailed text prompt such as, \"Apply the armor to the character, rendered in the specified art style, while maintaining the original pose.\"\nThis deep comprehension of instructions is critical. Our application dynamically constructs prompts that combine dozens of custom parameters, ranging from deleting specific elements and changing poses to applying complex textures and even \"evolving\" a character. Gemini's ability to parse and execute these layered instructions is what makes Project Chimera a versatile and powerful creative tool, transforming a single prompt into a comprehensive command center for image manipulation.\nThe features showcased in this hackathon represent just the starting point of Project Chimera's core potential. Moving forward, we plan to actively integrate more of Gemini's advanced features to revolutionize the user experience and push the boundaries of creative expression. The true potential of Project Chimera is only just beginning to unfold.\n\njin35tt. Project Chimera. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/competitions\/banana\/writeups\/project-chimera. 2025. Kaggle",

    "description":"The AI-powered creative toolkit for educators and students. Turn any lesson into a visual masterpiece with the magic of Nano Banana!\n\nEducation is magical, but the tools we use often aren't. We were inspired by the challenge educators face in finding or creating high-quality, specific visual aids for their lessons. Stock photos are generic, and creating custom graphics is time-consuming. We envisioned a tool that could act as a creative assistant for teachers and a playground for students, a place where any concept could be visualized instantly. Nanocation was born from this idea: to make learning unforgettable by making it visual.\n\nNanocation is a web-based AI toolkit powered by Gemini that transforms text and images into stunning educational visuals. It's a one-stop-shop for creative learning, offering five distinct tools:\nScience Sketchpad: Generates clear, textbook-quality scientific diagrams from a simple description. Users can even provide a style reference image to guide the AI.\nComic Creator: Turns any lesson or story into a fun comic strip. The magic here is that users can upload their own photo to become the star of their educational adventure!\nHistory Time Machine: A portal to the past! Users upload a photo and describe a historical scene to see themselves realistically placed in a different era.\nFuture You!: Allows students to visualize their future careers. Upload a photo, describe a profession, and see yourself as a firefighter, an astronaut, or a marine biologist.\nInvention Studio: Sparks curiosity and engineering thinking. Users can upload a photo of an object and ask the AI to reveal its inner workings with a detailed cutaway view or transform it into something completely new.",

It solves the common problem faced by designers and marketers who need to create high-quality, realistic product mockups without the cost and time of traditional photography or complex 3D rendering.\n\nThe core of the application is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image's advanced multimodal capabilities. Users provide two inputs: an image of the 3D model and a text prompt describing the desired scene. The model's visual reasoning analyzes the input image to understand the product's form, color, and texture, while its native multimodal architecture seamlessly combines this understanding with the text prompt. This allows for a precise, prompt-based editing process that places the product into a new, complex scene, such as \"in front of a hotel,\" while maintaining the subject's identity and visual consistency. The result is a photorealistic output image, bridging the gap between a standalone 3D model and a compelling marketing visual in a matter of seconds.\n\nRoot Glitch.

Setup is simple: install the extension, enter your Gemini API key, and upload your portrait. From there, just toggle a button and within seconds the extension generates a realistic try-on image, keeping your face, pose, and background unchanged while swapping only the clothing.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Nano Banana is integral to this project because it bridges your portrait and the product photo seamlessly. By leveraging Gemini through Nano Banana, the extension achieves high-quality garment replacement while preserving natural textures, lighting, and realism. This precise integration ensures the generated image looks authentic, making online shopping more engaging and helping solve one of fashion e-commerce\u2019s biggest problems: visualizing how clothes will actually look on you.",

    "description":"A personalized gifting app that generates hilarious book covers for the recipient along with the entire book\n\nHookMyBook is an application that allows users to create unique, personalized books as gifts. A critical and highly personal element of this experience is the book cover, which must feature the recipient while matching the book's chosen genre and tone. The primary challenge was to automate the creation of high-quality, custom book covers instantly, a task that would traditionally require manual graphic design work.\n\nThis application leverages the advanced image-to-image generation capabilities of the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. The model is central to solving the cover creation problem. It takes a user-uploaded photograph and, following a detailed prompt, seamlessly replaces the background, integrates the original subjects into a new scene, and intelligently adds text elements like the title, subtitle, and author's name. By preserving the people in the photo while completely reimagining their environment, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image acts as an automated \"in-painting\" and scene creation engine, turning a simple photo into a professional and contextually relevant book cover in seconds. This feature is the cornerstone of the app's personalization-at-scale promise.",

    "description":"Our app uses the new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image technology to turn pet photos into fun and interactive language lessons. The key idea is that a learner's pet becomes the main character of the lessons. To make this work, we use Gemini's ability to keep the pet looking the same across many different lessons and activities. This way, the learner always sees their pet in familiar form, which helps build a stronger connection and keeps learning engaging.\n\nGemini's wide world knowledge also helps us create images that feel real and culturally accurate. For example, when learning about Italian food, the pet might appear next to traditional dishes, or when practicing travel phrases, the pet could be in a realistic airport scene.\n\nBy combining these tools, we offer learners a highly personalized experience: lessons that feel playful, authentic, and built around their own beloved pet.",

The core of the project leverages the multimodal capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to interpret both image and text context for sequential editing.\nDuring development, the project was ultimately blocked by an insurmountable API access issue, appearing to be a regional or systemic quota limit on the free tier that persisted across different Google accounts, networks, and a 12-hour waiting period. The completed code and a conceptual video demonstrating the intended functionality have been submitted to showcase the project's vision and technical foundation.\n\nhttps:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/drive\/1ZJtZRiQpIHKWgCp19OD2_6Ny4rOfw4Y9?usp=sharing",

In each, an initial keyframe is generated, and subsequent frames are created by providing the model with the previous image and a new text prompt. This ensures absolute stylistic consistency and smooth visual transitions, which are critical for believable animation sequences. In \"Director Mode,\" the user provides these prompts manually, while in other modes, the AI generates them.\n\nThe second core feature is advanced style transfer, used exclusively in \"Upload Mode.\" Here, the model takes a user's uploaded image and a detailed stylistic prompt to intelligently redraw the subject into minimalist, transparent-background line art.",

Gemini is given both the floor plan for structural reference and a previous render for stylistic context. This critical step ensures every new image maintains architectural and thematic integrity, creating a believable and cohesive virtual space without visual jarring between different views of the same room.\n\nFinally, the 360\u00b0 tour is created using Gemini's Advanced composition. By providing the multiple room perspectives as inputs, the model intelligently stitches them into a single, seamless equirectangular panorama. This is more than a simple collage; Gemini understands the spatial relationships between the views.

    "description":"Immortalize your relationship by turning your photos into a custom comic where you are always the stars, powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash.\n\nOur project, StorySpark, directly tackles the primary obstacle in AI-driven visual storytelling: character inconsistency. The application's foundation is built upon Gemini 2.5 Flash's advanced multi-modal, image-and-text-to-image generation capability.\nFor each comic panel, we send a compound prompt to the API. This prompt contains not just a textual description of the scene, but critically, the user-uploaded reference photos of the couple. This technique instructs Gemini to condition its creative output on these specific visual anchors, ensuring it maintains the subjects' distinct likenesses\u2014their faces, hair, and core features\u2014across every panel.\nThis consistent character generation is not merely an enhancement; it is the central pillar of our application. It transforms our tool from a generic comic creator into a deeply personal narrative engine, allowing users to become the stars of their own story. Without Gemini's ability to ground each generation in reference images, our core promise of immortalizing a real couple's journey would be impossible to deliver, making this feature absolutely essential to our project's existence and \"wow\" factor.\n\nPeterNanoBano.

    "description":"Rewa helps users experiment with hairstyles, outfits, and makeup before committing in real life. Our original try-on pipeline used OpenAI\u2019s image models, which often produced flat overlays or struggled with consistency across different angles of a user\u2019s face.\nDuring the Nano Banana Hackathon, we integrated Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) and completely transformed the experience. Instead of simple overlays, Rewa now uses Gemini\u2019s fusion and editing capabilities to seamlessly blend new styles onto a user\u2019s photo while preserving their identity, facial structure, and natural textures.\nTo achieve this, we designed a pipeline that chains together multiple mega-prompts rather than relying on single, basic prompts. This approach gave us the consistency we needed hairstyles, makeup, and outfits now stay aligned across lighting conditions, facial expressions, and different selfies of the same person.\nWith Gemini, hairstyles retain realistic shadows and flow, makeup adapts intelligently to skin tone, and clothes wrap around the body shape rather than floating unnaturally. The result is a true AI-powered style studio: a dynamic self-expression platform where users can visualize their glow-up journey in a way that feels authentic, empowering, and magical.\n\ntheral moyo.

To ensure high-fidelity output, the model is provided with example pairs of input airfoils and their corresponding desired streamline outputs. This few-shot learning guides the model to generate a physically plausible visualization from the user's image. A low temperature (0.05) is used to ensure deterministic results.\n\nNext, the application performs Visual Reasoning and Classification. The newly generated image is fed back into the model in a second API call. A new prompt asks the model to analyze the image it just created and classify the aerodynamic conditions as \"Normal flow,\" \"Flow Separation,\" or \"Stall condition.\"\n\nThis technical pipeline\u2014moving from guided generation to analytical reasoning\u2014is central to the app. It transforms a static image into a CFD visualization without needing traditional numerical solvers, making aero analysis highly accessible.",

    "description":"A few days earlier Nano Banana dropped, and all I could see were high quality static images and its potential to be the perfect marketing images creator. My project, Sloppy Ads, is the direct result of this idea. Sloppy Ads is a full-stack app built to automate the marketing workflow, providing users with marketing image and a caption for each image.\nSloppy Ads is built around Gemini 2.5 Flash Image's core editing and stylization capabilities. A user uploads a product photo, fills a couple of text fields, and the app uses a series of battle-tested \"Creative Lens\" presets to generate a full campaign's worth of assets\u2014from studio shots to authentic UGC-style content.\nThe workflow is simple: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image handles the complex visual transformations, while Gemini 2.5 Flash generates context-aware captions for each new image. This dual-model approach turns a multi-day design process into seconds. For marketers, this means a constant stream of creative options, allowing them to test and iterate faster than ever before. It's a genuine game-changer for any team, built entirely on the Gemini API.\nI learned late about the hackathon so there are some propagating issues with url and all.\n\u2022 Official Website: https:\/\/sloppyads.com\n\u2022 Product Video url: https:\/\/x.com\/say_hi_harris\/status\/1964838617131749429\n\u2022 www version wasn\u2019t working yet\n\u2022 Anyone can login using Oauth or email\/password to test the product\n\u2022 20 Free generations so you can battle-test it\n\u2022 No payment gateway attached yet\n\ncryptoharris.

    "description":"An interactive storybook app that transforms you and your pet into anime heroes using Gemini\u2019s image generation.\n\nFor the Nano Banana Hackathon, I developed Storytale: Adventures with You and Your Pet\u2014an interactive storybook app that harnesses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) for rapid, high-fidelity AI image generation. The app immerses users and their pets as main characters in beautifully illustrated, anime-style narratives. Leveraging Nano Banana\u2019s real-time image editing capabilities, the storybook dynamically personalizes each character, adapting their poses and facial expressions to perfectly match the unfolding narrative. Characters are first generated on empty backgrounds, and then, through advanced background integration, they are seamlessly composited into a variety of imaginative settings. Whether it\u2019s a neon-lit cityscape, a snowy mountain, or any other scene, the characters blend so naturally into their environments that each page achieves a cohesive, storybook-quality look.\n\nTo ensure visual and thematic continuity, the app applies a vivid \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters\u201d style across every page, so the user and their pet maintain a unified artistic identity. The engine intelligently interprets story context and employs prompt-based generation to update details of both characters and backgrounds as the plot evolves, ensuring every scene feels alive and tailored. Beyond storytelling, users also have the opportunity to transform their in-story characters into collectible, toy-like figurine renders, extending Nano Banana\u2019s creative possibilities. Nano Banana\u2019s outstanding speed and flexibility are crucial for these real-time interactions, allowing instant edits, style transfers, and scene updates, all powered by Gemini\u2019s robust image models. The result is a dynamic platform where users see themselves\u2014and their pets\u2014become heroes in their own anime adventure, with seamless integration into every scene, showcasing the true power of Nano Banana for interactive, image-driven applications.",

As it was his last competition before retirement, he chose to be alone at the kiss & cry section, without his coaches. Every time I reviewed this story, I felt sad and sorrowful.

I push this further by using Gemini's ability to interpret specific stylistic prompts (e.g., \"Vintage comic book style\"), ensuring a consistent aesthetic throughout the user's journey.\n\nThe most innovative application of Gemini is in my graphic novel generator. Here, I utilize its image-and-text prompting (multimodal) understanding. Each panel is generated by providing Gemini with three inputs: a text prompt describing the action, a character reference sheet image to maintain visual consistency, and a panel template image. Gemini intelligently synthesizes these inputs, creating an illustration that adheres to character design, story context, and page layout. This sophisticated use of Gemini's image features is what makes KukuLala AI's deeply personalized and visually rich storytelling possible.\n\nMihir Panchal.

    "description":"Upload a photo, select an object, and watch it come to life in a stop-motion animation.\n\nThe process is simple yet powerful. First, Nano Banana analyzes your uploaded photo and identifies prominent objects. You then act as the director, selecting which object to animate\u2014a cloud, a cat, or a coffee cup. The AI generates a sequence of incremental text prompts to guide the animation.\n\nThe core magic lies in its frame-by-frame generation loop. Nano Banana creates the first frame based on your original image, then uses that new frame to generate the next, and so on. This \"digital game of telephone\" ensures a remarkably coherent and fluid stop-motion effect. The final animation is presented in an interactive flipbook player, allowing you to control the speed and download your creation as a high-quality GIF, perfectly blending tactile nostalgia with cutting-edge AI.",

Here's how it works: You choose a secret topic\u2014anything from \"bananas are radioactive\" to \"coffee keeps you awake\"\u2014and watch as AI players create illustrations one by one. But there's a catch: one of them is a spy who doesn't know your topic!\nThe spy must fake their way through by analyzing everyone else's drawings, desperately trying to blend in. Meanwhile, legitimate players walk a dangerous line: revealing enough to prove they're real without giving the spy too much information. The result? A tense visual puzzle where every image could be genuine\u2026 or a clever fake.\nYou'll analyze subtle patterns across three increasingly difficult rooms. Is that vague drawing from someone being careful, or a clueless spy? Is that perfect illustration from a real player, or a spy who cracked the code? One wrong guess and it's game over.\nPowered by Nano Banana's image generation, the game creates dynamic visual conversations with context-aware AI agents and consistent artistic styles\u2014transforming image AI into an addictive deduction experience.\n\nKike Guti\u00e9rrez.

    "description":"An AI comic generation platform creating The demand for short-form comic strips in marketing andunwavering character consistency in minutes.\n\nFueled by the rise of short-attention span entertainment platforms like TikTok and Instagram, there's a significant need for short-form comic strips in marketing and entertainment. Traditional methods are slow and costly, while existing AI tools fail at the most critical element: maintaining a character's appearance across multiple scenes. This inconsistency shatters narrative immersion and renders AI-generated comics commercially unviable.\n\nBy orchestrating a workflow centered on Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, Comic Crafter addresses these challenges. The application's core innovation is the generation of a multi-angle character reference sheet \u2014 \"Digital Blueprint\". This blueprint becomes the foundational visual guide. For every subsequent panel, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image\u2019s advanced capability to interpret and fuse image data is used to render the character with perfect consistency to the blueprint.",

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image overcomes this limitation by generating from both text and image references, supported by one million tokens of context and message chaining. This ensures continuity in every stage of creation.\n\nAnother difficulty is the complexity of editing existing images. Many systems fail to preserve quality or coherence, forcing users to restart their work. Gemini 2.5 Flash Image enables precise generation, editing, and text rendering within images, ensuring that modifications remain faithful to the original design and stylistic identity.\n\nCreative workflows also face fragmentation, often requiring multiple tools for generation, annotation, and rendering. This slows down the process and creates inefficiencies.

    "description":"Leveraging Nano Banana's multi-image fusion to reconstruct clear investigative scenes from fragmented and incomplete visual evidence.\n\nIn criminal investigations, industrial analysis, and historical reconstruction, evidence is rarely a single, perfect picture. Instead, it's a collection of shattered fragments: a blurry security still, a partial witness sketch, a distorted reflection, a technical blueprint. In isolation, these pieces are often inconclusive, leading to investigative dead ends and preventing a clear understanding of events. The core challenge is that no single piece tells the whole story.\n\nThe Visual Witness System is a web-based application designed to bridge this critical gap. It is an intelligent investigative aid that ingests multiple, disparate pieces of visual evidence and fuses them into a single, coherent, and photorealistic scene. By providing investigators with a unified picture, our tool transforms fragmented data into actionable intelligence, accelerating analysis and generating powerful new leads.",

It also performs image-to-image interpolation with text guidance, creating fluid transitions between two frames for in-between animation. Furthermore, the system supports multimodal input and output, allowing for both images and text in a single request and response. Once finished, assets can be exported to Godot with a single click.",

    "description":"Nano Banana Agent\nNano Banana Agent is a lightweight, modular prompt-rewriting pipeline built on Google\u2019s Artificial Decision Kernel (ADK). It serves as a preprocessing component to refine user input before passing it to a generative image model (Gemini 2.5-Flash-Image). The agent takes raw user prompts, and transforms them via structured JSON output, enforcing constraints on layout, style, content, and tone, improving consistency and generation quality.\nKey Features:\nPrompt normalization and rewriting: parses free-text user instructions and reformulates them into structured, model-friendly prompts that drive better, more deterministic image outcomes.\nSession-based interaction: uses an in-memory session service to maintain continuity and context over a multi-step rewriting workflow, enabling iterative refining of user intentions.\nRunner-driven architecture: built as a pipeline of \u201cagent steps\u201d via the ADK Runner interface, making it easy to extend or swap out sub-agents for custom rewriting behaviors.\nMinimal dependencies: focuses solely on prompt transformation logic, leaving image generation to Gemini, so it\u2019s fast, easy to integrate, and adaptable to Web or CLI front ends.\nNano Banana Agent acts as the \u201cbrains behind the prompt\u201d: cleaning up user input, filling in missing structure (e.g. panel counts, character descriptions, style tags), extracting or injecting JSON fields, and preparing it for image-generation models to consume reliably.\n\nDoan Gia Huy Vu.

    "description":"Built an educational visual learning app called Imaginator inside AI studio - using the narrative \"to teach the why and how behind concepts and not just the what\". Imaginator uses three key features of Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to create character-consistent educational stories.\n\u2022 Nano Banana \ud83c\udf4c Character Consistency\nI have customized prompts to maintain the same historical figure across multiple educational scenes. With nano banana, Imaginator generates 4-12 scenes where Einstein looks consistent as he guides learners through relativity concepts. Before this, each scene showed different-looking people, breaking storytelling flow. This helps people follow familiar guides.\n\u2022 Concept-Focused Visual Generation\nI customized prompts that make Gemini 2.5 Flash Image visualize actual concepts being taught. Instead of portraits, Imaginator's images show spacetime bending or gravity's effects, with the historical figure explaining what's happening. This helps anyone see abstract ideas in action.\n\u2022 Reference Integration with Style Consistency\nUsers can upload their own character images or style preferences. Imaginator uses these references with nano banana's consistency features, allowing creators to make material matching their vision while keeping characters recognizable.\nThis attempts to app turns complex concepts into visual stories that help people understand ideas rather than memorize facts.\n\nMukul Kulkarni.

    "description":"BYFOAWA is a build your own game story book adventure where you transform your real friends and take them to weird places, all generative.\n\nWe created an interactive storytelling game where players upload photos of friends, transform them into fantasy characters, and guide them through absurd choose-your-own-adventure scenarios with persistent visual continuity.\nGemini flash powers our Character Portrait system, converting real photos into fantasy D&D characters while preserving facial recognition. Most critically, Gemini's multi-image processing enables our Squad Photo Generation, where we send multiple transformed character portraits and receive cohesive group scenes with proper character placement and identity preservation.\nOur Character Identity Persistence System relies on Gemini's ability to reference previous images during transformations. When characters gain battle scars or magical powers, we send their current portrait alongside transformation instructions, ensuring visual continuity while accumulating changes. The model's prompt understanding prevents character mix-ups in group scenes through explicit image-to-character mapping (\"IMAGE 1 = Alice, IMAGE 2 = Bob\").\nGemini 2.5 Flash text generation drives our Dynamic Story Generation, creating 7-beat adventure narratives with branching choices, while generating contextual character customization options based on world settings. The streaming capabilities provide real-time story generation, and JSON-structured responses enable complex game data parsing for choices, transformations, and scene descriptions.\nWithout Gemini's multi-modal processing and image consistency features, maintaining recognizable characters across hundreds of generated scenes would be impossible.\n\nThomas Tobin. bring your friends on a wacky adventure. https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/competitions\/banana\/writeups\/bring-your-friends-on-an-adventure. 2025.

Details like colors, shapes, or accessories will be different, making it impossible to merge them into a believable 3D object. As the comparison images show, other models fail at this task.

    "description":"Bedtime Story generator a using nano banana for consistent image generation and eleven labs for audio narration.\n\nThis project uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to bring children\u2019s bedtime stories to life through interactive, visually consistent storytelling. I leveraged Gemini\u2019s character and attire consistency to generate panel-by-panel illustrations where the same characters appear seamlessly across scenes. This ensures that children can follow the story without distraction, unlike traditional image generation tools where characters often change.\nBy pairing this with Nano Banana, created an end-to-end storytelling experience where a static bedtime narrative becomes a dynamic visual journey. Parents can input a simple story, and the system generates an illustrated, semi-animated version within minutes.\n\nAlso used eleven labs ai for audio narration for more interactive experience. The audio narration goes on with the captioned image slide.\nEntire journey is soothing and relaxing.",

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is the core creative engine that transforms raw local data into stunning, on-brand visuals that connect with communities.\nOur system leverages Gemini\u2019s world knowledge and reality fusion to create context-aware ads, fusing a brand's product with the specific vibe and landmarks of a target neighborhood. This creates an immediate, authentic connection, as seen in our demo where a coffee product is placed in a scene featuring Berkeley's Sather Gate.\nThe true \"wow\" factor lies in the interactive refinement loop, powered by Gemini\u2019s natural language editing and in-painting. A marketing manager can instantly direct changes like \"change the drink to a latte\" or \"make the scene feel like evening,\" altering the entire campaign's narrative with simple text.\nThis dynamic visual intelligence, combined with product and brand consistency across all generated assets, ensures every ad feels both authentic to the brand and perfectly native to the community. This synergy transforms a national marketing strategy into thousands of personal, community-level conversations, a feat previously impossible at this scale and speed.\n\nAryan Rane.

    "description":"Nano\u2011Banana extracts pure artistic style from multiple reference images, fuses those styles into a single, high-quality textual style description, and applies that fused style to a target image while preserving its content. The server uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image capabilities to analyze inline images and return structured textual descriptions, to generate fused textual style descriptions with controlled prompts, and to produce final stylized images by sending inline image data together with the fused style prompt. These Gemini features (image-aware prompt extraction, JSON-friendly text output, and image generation via generateContent \/ generateContentStream) are central: they allow us to reliably isolate style (not subject), programmatically compose styles with influence weights and options, and perform single-shot image stylization that preserves semantic content. The result is an interactive, low-friction pipeline that gives users control over blend weights, texture emphasis, color source, and quick iteration for creative exploration.\n\nRyomen Sukuna.

She is not an outsider with powers, but a native daughter of the mountains, chosen by the very creatures often seen as harbingers of death: the vultures. Unlike those who see these birds as a threat, she was raised to revere them. Instead of being preyed upon, she was selected by the vultures, a symbiotic relationship born of respect and mutual survival. They are her guardians, their vast wings and keen eyes a shield against those who would harm the land and its people. The ancient gods of the mountains granted her the gift of foresight, allowing her to see the devastating consequences of greed before they happen. This vision is a heavy burden, but it's tempered by the wisdom she has inherited from her ancestors, passed down through generations of Andean storytellers. She doesn't just repel attacks; she inspires a deeper connection to the earth, a reminder that we are all part of a delicate web, and that the greatest strength lies not in domination, but in harmony.

The game dynamically generates a consistent, explorable world where players feel like they\u2019ve stepped inside the Pok\u00e9mon universe.\nNano Banana is the engine behind world generation and personalization. It produces 2:1 panoramic images that are wrapped into a seamless street-view environment, allowing players to \u201cwalk\u201d through towns, forests, and Pok\u00e9mon Centers with full continuity. This consistency ensures that if a player turns left into a Pok\u00e9Mart or right into a forest, the world always remains coherent.\nBeyond exploration, Nano Banana powers dynamic customization: players can decorate their rooms, hang a Nurse Joy poster, or change their environment in real time with natural language prompts. It also enhances interactivity\u2014NPCs and Pok\u00e9mon battles occur within the generated environments, while character relationships and dialogue flow naturally.\nBy blending AI-driven creativity, visual consistency, and interactive storytelling, Pok\u00e9mon: Go Bananas Adventure showcases how Nano Banana can go far beyond static image generation\u2014transforming it into a living, explorable world where players can battle, bond, and build their own stories.\nGo Bananas, live the adventure!\n\nfanxvirat.

It's built for writers, educators, and creators who have great story ideas but lack the artistic skills to bring them to life. Traditionally, making manga requires a lot of drawing talent, which can be a major hurdle.\n\nThis project uses Google's powerful AI model, \"Nano Banana\" (officially known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image), to do the hard work. Nano Banana is great at turning your text descriptions into manga-style pictures.

Bored?Opposite uses fun, everyday narratives to help kids understand math by showing relevance first, then teaching concepts.\n\nBored?Opposite transforms 11 difficult math topics into short comic strips, explainer videos, and an interactive AI tutor (Maya). Kids meet concepts through short, cheesy stories, then watch a 60\u201390s explainer and interact with Maya who guides step-by-step problem solving, adapts to the learner, and answers follow-ups.\n\nWhat we learned:\nAI accelerates production, but human curation is essential for quality, voice, and pedagogical correctness.

We rely on four features: text\u2011driven editing; multi\u2011image fusion with multiple reference images for identity consistency; vision\u2011language reasoning (chat + vision) to inspect uploaded image(s), infer intent, and draft a structured action prompt; and region\u2011bounded edits via hotspot (when provided) with conservative global adjustments otherwise.\nThese features are central to our demos, because they let users steer complex, production\u2011grade edits with sentences, not layers. Gemini 2.5 Flash Image preserves face, pose, and skin tone while performing retouching, cleanup, relighting, background fitting, and reference\u2011guided fusion in near\u2011real time. The conversational surface explains each decision and allows corrective follow\u2011ups, so language becomes pixels with traceable steps.\nWe also use Gemini Image 4 for new image generations, and can be directly add to the project for smooth workspace.\n\nRenyi Cao.

The application's core functionality is powered by Gemini.\nFirst, it leverages the multimodal understanding of gemini-2.5-flash. Users upload an image of their available ingredients, and the model analyzes this visual data alongside text-based user preferences (like cuisine and cooking time) to generate tailored recipe ideas. The model's ability to output structured JSON is critical, as it ensures the recipe data (ingredients, instructions, calories) is delivered in a clean, parsable format for a seamless user interface.\nSecond, to elevate the user experience, the app uses imagen-4.0-generate-001 to create photorealistic images of the suggested dishes. This visualization feature is central to the app's appeal, helping users envision the final product and inspiring them to start cooking. Together, these AI features turn ingredient chaos into culinary inspiration, making meal planning effortless and exciting.\n\nPM_Nicolas.

I wanted bright, sunny photos to capture this milestone, but manually editing the weather in Photoshop was far too complex. Adjusting the sky, lighting, shadows, and atmosphere to make the image look natural required advanced skills, significant time, and effort. Since these photos marked an important moment in my life, I wanted them to reflect the brightness and joy of the day.\n\nThis inspired me to develop an AI-powered application capable of instantly transforming weather and atmosphere in photos.

Most generative tools output isolated images; crafting a coherent strip with recurring characters, stable tone, and controlled framing still takes manual storyboarding.\n\nSolution. Manga Matic turns a short prompt into a finished four-panel comic in Google AI Studio. It drafts a compact script (panel beats, concise dialogue, and shot hints) and then renders each panel to match that plan. Crucially, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image maintains character consistency across panels\u2014leveraging brief style descriptors and (optionally) reference portraits so faces, outfits, and inking remain stable from frame to frame. Users pick story tone (e.g., kish\u014dtenketsu, slice-of-life), art style (mono, sh\u014dnen-ink, pastel, etc.), and layout guidance to keep the strip readable and on-brand.\n\nImpact. Four panels are snackable stories that boost scannability and shareability. Product teams can explain features or policy changes in under a minute; marketing can turn release notes into comics for social feeds. Consistent recurring characters build brand memory, while panel-level generation makes it easy to A\/B test punchlines, tones, and shots. The result: faster storytelling cycles, clearer messaging, and a recognizable narrative style that audiences want to follow.",

Meanwhile, the \u201cStoryboard Helper\u201d showcases Nano Banana\u2019s unique strength: consistency.

    "description":"Generate character-consistent comic strips in minutes using the power of generative AI. From character concept to a print-ready PDF.\n\n** \ud83c\udf1f Introduction**\nComic Crafter AI is a web-based application designed to democratize comic creation. It tackles one of the biggest challenges in AI image generation\u2014character consistency\u2014by building a seamless, intuitive workflow for generating complete comic strips. Whether you're a writer storyboarding a scene, a marketer creating visual content, or a hobbyist exploring creative AI, this tool removes the artistic barrier and lets your narrative shine.\n\n\u2728 Key Features\n\ud83e\udd16 Consistent Character Generation: Define your protagonist once. The AI uses the image from the previous panel as a reference to keep your character's appearance, clothing, and style consistent across the entire comic.\n\u270d\ufe0f AI Narrative Assistant: Stuck for a story? Provide a simple prompt (e.g., \"a detective finds a mysterious clue\"), and the AI will generate a complete, multi-panel storyboard with scene descriptions, character actions, and dialogue.\n\u2699\ufe0f Full Creative Control: Manually write or edit every scene description, character expression, and line of dialogue. You have fine-tuned control over every narrative detail before generation.\n\ud83d\udd04 Resilient Panel Generation: If a single panel fails to generate, the process doesn't stop! The failed panel is clearly marked with an in-app Retry button, allowing you to regenerate it without losing your progress or consistency.\n\ud83c\udfa8 Thematic PDF Export: Download your finished comic as a high-quality, multi-page PDF. The PDF features a vibrant, retro comic-book background with a halftone dot pattern and an intelligent 2x3 panel grid for a professional, print-ready look.\n\ud83d\ude80 How It Works\nThe application guides you through a simple three-step process to create your comic.",

    "description":"Tired of heavy rendering software? Sketch, chat, and create stunning visuals in a flash. It's rendering, but light as air.\n\nA.I.R (Architecture AI Render) is a lightweight, conversational renderer for architects, powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. Instead of treating the model as a simple text-to-image generator, A.I.R uses it for precise visual control. You upload a sketch, click a point or draw a polygon mask, add a short instruction, and the app builds a multimodal prompt (image + mask + text) to perform point-level edits and inpainting while preserving the original structure. This makes quick, targeted changes\u2014materials, openings, lighting\u2014without rebuilding the whole image, enabling fast, transparent iteration.\n\nThe workflow is organized into tabs that mirror how architects think. Upload accepts image files and also supports quick screen capture and crop so you can start from whatever is on your screen. Edit is where you type prompts, get keyword suggestions, and run point or polygon edits for precise local adjustments. Reference is the style-fusion engine: use a moodboard or a single reference image to apply one-tap corrections and blend tone, materiality, and lighting into your sketch; an influence slider lets you dial the effect from subtle to transformative while keeping geometry intact. Moodboard helps you assemble and record reference sets so your visual direction is consistent across iterations. Gallery stores results you like for quick review and comparison. Ask opens a dialogue with the AI about \u201cwhat to do next,\u201d proposing ways to push the image further or branch into alternatives.",

For each target platform (e.g., Amazon, Zomato, Instagram), we provide Gemini with a highly structured prompt that encodes the platform's specific requirements from Amazon's mandated pure white background (#FFFFFF) to Zomato's need for appetizing, vibrant food imagery. Gemini doesn't just resize; it performs semantic, knowledge-aware transformations. It understands the context of \"e-commerce compliance\" versus \"social media engagement,\" allowing it to execute complex edits like intelligent background replacement, object-centric recomposition, professional color grading, and style-consistent outpainting to change aspect ratios.\n\nThis ability to fuse a platform's digital \"reality\" with the original image is the central innovation of our application.

Traditionally, producing believable lifestyle imagery requires expensive photo shoots, complex editing, or long lead times. AuraSync eliminates these barriers by allowing anyone to generate a photorealistic scene and seamlessly place a product into it using just a single prompt.\n\nAuraSync leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in a way that goes beyond simple generation. It fuses multiple inputs (scene + product + placement instructions) into a single composite, then allows rapid prompt driven refinements without needing manual edits. The \u201clock-and-refine\u201d workflow is novel: once a base composition is created, scene and product inputs are fixed, and users can iteratively adjust lighting, scale, style, or mood with natural language.

    "subtitle":"From any Streetview Image in Google Maps to Images generated by Nano Banana",
    "description":"Terraformer is an innovative web application developed for the Google Nano Banana 48 Hour Challenge that redefines AI image generation. The core problem it addresses is the critical lack of geographic precision in current generative AI. While impressive at abstract creation, existing models struggle to transform specific, recognizable real-world locations into imaginative, contextually rich artistic interpretations. This leaves a significant gap for applications demanding geographical accuracy in visual storytelling and design.\n\nTerraformer directly bridges this gap by leveraging Google Gemini 2.5 Flash's advanced image-to-image capabilities and its unique \"world knowledge integration.\" Our application provides a seamless workflow: users pinpoint any location on Earth via an interactive Google Maps interface, from which real-time satellite imagery is extracted. This precise geographical image then serves as the core input to the Gemini 2.5 Flash API, alongside user-selected creative prompts for style (e.g., Realistic, Pixel Art, Oil Painting), population (e.g., Bananas, Robots, Superheroes), and time period (e.g., Medieval, 1980s, Prehistoric). This direct integration allows Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate immersive, street-level artistic interpretations that are both geographically accurate and richly imagined\u2014a feat previously impossible. We\u2019ve effectively given AI a \"GPS for its imagination,\" enabling it to ground boundless creativity in specific reality.\n\nEric Risco de la Torre.

But, Google Gemini's AI companion 2.5 Flash Image, fondly called Nano Banana, provides capability to transmute text to top-notch images with dynamically indispensable features. To spread climate awareness, the author chooses the comic storytelling route by creating the AI-enabled app EcoMatrix to promote environmental awareness. The Nano Banana model allows users to prompt their text and images to generate a blend of text and high-fidelity comics in this venture.\n\nThe app integrates text and image prompts of the user into a seamless \"blends realities\". These features give life to the characters of the comic story. The \"User-as-hero\" feature enables it to personalize the talk and narrative by uploading a photo of the user. The Gemini Multimodal model generates a visual description by fusing the prompted text and photo. The 4-panel comics are created with the requisite aspect ratio. The \"apply comic book style\" prompt transforms the base image into a comic of the desired style. It can generate a maximum of three pages. Quick effects can be employed to add new features from a suite of pre-written prompts. With image refinement options, the image and text can be iteratively modified and improved multiple times.",

This utilizes the model's ability to understand and execute edits on existing images, creating a dialogue between user and AI.\n\nThese features make complex design tasks accessible through natural language interaction, eliminating traditional software complexity while maintaining professional-quality results. The model's image understanding and generation capabilities enable seamless creative workflows.",

    "description":"Goal: Transform the abstract experience of dreams into tangible, visual art and meaningful insights using AI.\nProblem: Dreams are an incredibly powerful but fleeting part of our lives. They are often difficult to recall and even harder to explain to others. This project aims to bridge the gap between a private, subconscious experience and a concrete, shareable record.\nSolution: Ruyanla is a multi-modal AI tool designed to be your personal dream weaver. It leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API (also known as \"Nano Banana\") to create highly personalized outputs. User simply provides a written description of his\/her dream, along with his\/her own images that are relevant to the dream's themes or characters. The system then processes this information using a powerful AI pipeline to create two key outputs:\nVivid Visuals: Ruyanla will generate a series of unique, surreal, and personalized images. By using the user's uploaded images as a reference, the AI can maintain character and style consistency, ensuring the generated visuals feel like a true \"snapshot\" of the dream. These images serve as a visual diary that user can revisit and reflect on.\nDream Analysis: The system provides a comprehensive breakdown of user dream's potential meaning. This analysis draws from two sources:\nCultural & Symbolic: It interprets common dream elements through the lens of psychology and ancient dream symbolism. This includes fascinating traditions like the Turkish belief of telling bad dreams to running water, which is a powerful way to release and cleanse negative thoughts.\nScientific: It offers insights from modern neuroscience, explaining the possible biological and cognitive reasons behind what the user experienced.\nWhy It Matters: Ruyanla is more than just a dream interpreter; it's a tool for self-discovery and creative expression. By giving users dreams a visual and analytical form, they can gain a deeper understanding of your own thoughts and emotions, and even use these outputs as a source of inspiration for art, writing, or other creative projects.\n\nahmet bektes.

    "description":"Lets couples upload two separate photos and instantly see themselves merged into realistic, styled wedding scenes in various venues.\n\nAI Wedding Photographer is a creative project built for the Google Nano Banana Hackathon. The idea started from a simple thought: what if we could combine two ordinary photos and turn them into a stunning wedding picture? With this tool, users can upload two images and instantly see a merged \u201cafter\u201d result that looks like it was captured by a professional photographer.\nIt is not just about filters or edits, but about reimagining moments. A couple can place themselves anywhere, from the top of Mount Everest to a vintage palace ballroom, and the AI creates the scene as if it were real. The experience is playful, emotional, and easy to understand, making it feel like having your own personal photographer who never runs out of ideas.\nThis project is more than just fun. It shows how AI can bring storytelling and memories to life in ways that feel beautiful and magical. Whether for weddings, anniversaries, or just for fun, the AI Wedding Photographer gives people a glimpse of what is possible when creativity meets technology.\n\nBerwan Barzinji.

The app accepts three image inputs per scene\u2014each slot can be a character, background, prop, or style reference. Upload your three images, add a prompt, and the app composes a unified frame. It supports outfit swapping and background replacement per scene while preserving character identity and style consistency across as many scenes as you create\u2014a coherent, adaptable workflow for storytelling, design iteration, and rapid experimentation.\n\nExample 1: Input = two character images + one background.\nPrompt idea: \u201cCombine both characters into one scene on this background.\u201d\nOutcome: A single final image where two characters appear together on the chosen background.",

    "description":"StoryCraft AI \u2014 Turn a Single Idea into a Complete Video Story with Gemini 2.5 Flash\n\nVideo\n\nStoryCraft AI is a universal storytelling platform that allows anyone \u2014 including children, non-writers, and casual creators \u2014 to turn a simple idea into a complete, narrated video story using only text or voice input. We leveraged Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate key visual scenes from an AI-written narrative structure, making it central to the storytelling process.\nThe user starts with just a single sentence idea \u2014 for example, \"a dog finds a magic bone.\" The system uses real-time LLMs to expand that into a full story (introduction, buildup, climax, and resolution), then breaks it into discrete scenes. Each scene is converted into a descriptive visual prompt, and passed to Gemini Flash, which returns vivid, coherent images that visually represent the story beats. Simultaneously, the full story is narrated using ElevenLabs TTS, and the narration is synchronized with the scene images to create a polished, ~60-second video using Fal for video assembly. The result is a downloadable and shareable video, made entirely from voice or text input \u2014 with no editing or technical skills required.\nThis project demonstrates how Gemini Flash can power automated video storytelling, combining voice, visuals, and AI-written narratives into a fully automated, zero-effort creative experience.\n\nhttps:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1Gq3tmWXP6zWhTKSVMMmbuvB2BAbNVQxP?usp=sharing",

The answers are usually text-only, and while they can be accurate, they\u2019re not always easy to picture or follow in real life. A farmer reading about how to spot a crop disease or set up drip irrigation still has to imagine what that actually looks like, which can lead to confusion or mistakes.\n\nIllustrated Farming Answers solves this by combining LLM text with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) to add visuals where they matter most. Instead of flooding every sentence with images, the system highlights just the most important steps or explanations and generates either a diagram (for clear instructions) or a cartoon (for simple storytelling).\n\nWe\u2019re showing it in farming because it\u2019s a field full of practical, visual problems, but the same approach could work for any DIY knowledge. The goal is simple: make LLM answers easier to understand by showing people what the words mean, not just telling them.",

We pinch to take a new photo to send to fal.ai NanoBanana to turn our rough 3D model into a real picture.\nWhat if you can time travel through a photograph to get the perfect shot? Nearly Life Size Live Demo from my AI3D Nano Dimensions app. Here we take a postcard depicting Penn Station in the early 1900s, use MoGe to convert it into a sparse hallucination-free point cloud that we can now walk through.

This eliminates the need for complex text descriptions.\nThe Canvas API captures real-time drawing strokes and converts them into base64-encoded PNG data for AI processing.\n\nUsers can erase specific parts of the generated images and describe the changes in natural language. This inpainting functionality creates transparent regions through canvas manipulation, and Gemini 2.5 Flash Image interprets these regions as editing masks to fill in based on surrounding context and textual instructions.\nThe AI understands erased pixels as editable areas, seamlessly integrating new elements while preserving the original content.",
